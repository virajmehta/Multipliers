        Each student takes 28 classes, so 56 semesters
        These students have 4 classes that are essentially free (sport, art, yearbook, etc.) where they are a guaranteed 100
        To contend for the valedictorianship, a student must take between 15 and 19 AP classes and between 4 and 7 PAP classes, which will be uniformly randomly modeled
        To contend for the valedictorianship, a student will have 96 <= grade <= 100 for an AP, a 97-100 for PAP and a 98-100 for regular
        This covers the 4 unweighted a year thing and typical progressions through other requirements
        This simulation weights AP classes by 1.2 and pre-AP classes by 1.1
